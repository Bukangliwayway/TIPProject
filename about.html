          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            On February 8, 1962, a group of educators headed by Engr. Demetrio
            A. Quirino Jr. established the Technological Institute of the
            Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>TIP laid down its objectives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to maintain a high standard of instruction;</li>
            <li>
              to bring within the reach of the masses the blessings of higher
              education; and
            </li>
            <li>
              to cooperate with the government in the implementation of its
              amelioration programs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The school committed itself to educating and developing men and
            women who could turn the wheels of progress and industry. T.I.P.’s
            initial offering of courses included Chemical Engineering, Civil
            Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and
            Architecture. It also offered Industrial Education, Industrial Arts,
            Liberal Arts, High School, and various trade courses.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/about-geninfo.jpg" alt="" width="300px" />
          <p>
            T.I.P.’s first site was the Lorenzana Building in Quiapo, Manila.
            The school had an initial enrollment of 2,400 which steadily
            increased throughout the years, prompting the school to slowly but
            surely expand. In 1967, it set up its main site at G. Puyat Street,
            Quiapo, Manila.
          </p>
          <p>
            T.I.P. then directed itself towards specialization in the field of
            technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course in
            Marine Engineering. Then in 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education, and
            High School programs were phased out to make way for the school’s
            new thrust.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1981, additional buildings were leased and the T.I.P. P. Casal,
            Quiapo location was opened to accommodate the growing student
            population which had reached over 23,000. T.I.P. Arlegui was opened
            three years later across P. Casal, both areas being collectively
            known as the T.I.P. Manila campus. Currently, T.I.P. Manila has four
            (4) main buildings across the combined 2.3-hectares of the two
            sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            The founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along 20th Avenue of
            Cubao as their answer to the Philippine government’s call for
            dispersal to decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the
            years, the Quezon City campus acquired adjacent properties,
            including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard in the early 2000s. At
            present, T.I.P. Quezon City has ten (10) main buildings spread out
            in its 3.3-hectare site.
          </p>
          <p>
            T.I.P.’s institutional campaign for quality began in 1999. The
            school’s Quality Management System (QMS) was certified compliant
            with the international standard ISO 9001:1994 by Det Norska Veritas
            (DNV) during this year. The T.I.P. QMS has since then passed regular
            ISO recertification and surveillance audits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The turn of the millennium also saw T.I.P.’s campaign to externally
            validate the quality of its programs. From 2000 to the present,
            T.I.P. has been voluntarily applying its programs for local and
            international accreditations from respected organizations. These
            accreditations include ones from ABET, the US-based global gold
            standard in engineering and computing accreditation; the Seoul
            Accord, a multilateral agreement among agencies allowing
            professional mobility between the Philippines and the pact’s
            signatory countries; Philippine Association of Colleges and
            Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) under the
            umbrella of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the
            Philippines (FAAP); the Philippine Technological Council; and the
            Philippine Computer Society (PCS) Information and Computing
            Accreditation Board (PICAB).
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also
            awarded 16 Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development to both
            T.I.P. campuses. Moreover, CHED also awarded Autonomous Status to
            both T.I.P. Quezon City and T.I.P. Manila in 2016 and again in 2019.
            Autonomous status is the highest honor CHED can bestow upon a higher
            education institution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the nationwide K-12 basic and secondary education
            program implementation, T.I.P. applied for and was granted permit to
            offer a standalone Senior High School (SHS) program in 2015. The
            strands offered by the T.I.P. SHS currently include Science,
            Technology, and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy, Business, and
            Management (ABM); and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS).
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of its campaign towards programmatic excellence on a national
            and international level, T.I.P. also embarked on a new direction.
            Called T.I.P. TechnoCoRe, this thrust was established in 2017 to
            institutionalize Technopreneurship and Collaborative Applied
            Research into its brand of education. T.I.P. TechnoCoRe involves
            instilling the core technopreneurship skills of (1)
            problem-opportunity formulation, (2) ideation, (3) validation, and
            (4) execution into T.I.P. students, faculty members, researchers,
            and other stakeholders. T.I.P. TechnoCoRe also involves the active
            establishment of collaborative applied research partnerships with
            government, industry, and other organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As its commitment to this thrust, T.I.P. in 2019 opened the T.I.P.
            TechnoCoRe building in its Quezon City campus. It is a seven-storey
            innovation hub housing T.I.P.’s state-of-the-art classrooms, seminar
            rooms, computer rooms, and engineering, computing, and fabrication
            laboratories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming from the heels of collaboration, 2019 also saw T.I.P.
            partnering with the Far Eastern University (FEU) to establish
            Edustria High School at the LIMA Technology Center in Lipa,
            Batangas. This joint venture educational offering aims to provide
            industry-relevant education through active partnerships with nearby
            local and multinational corporations that shall enable its students
            to achieve meaningful careers, economic upliftment, and life
            aspirations.
          </p>
          <p>
            2020 saw the world getting hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure
            education continuity and the community’s safety, T.I.P. exclusively
            implemented online and flexible learning for all T.I.P. students in
            the 1st Semester of SY 2020-2021. Within months from the start of
            the pandemic, the institution focused on reengineering its services,
            redesigning processes, and conducting countless training to
            adequately prepare the school for this new normal of teaching and
            learning. T.I.P. LEADS—which stands for Learning Experience Using
            Alternative-Design Systems—came to be. It is the collectivity of all
            these efforts especially towards online student-centric initiatives.
            T.I.P. LEADS is the school’s innovative way of making the remote
            learning experience better for T.I.P.ians, wherever they may be.
          </p>
          <p>
            At present, despite the pandemic, the Technological Institute of the
            Philippines remains firmly committed to the preservation of global
            excellence, leadership in engineering and technological education in
            the Philippines, and continuous improvement for its students,
            alumni, and employees alike.

          <h1>Cleanliness in Mind, Body and Surroundings</h1>
          <p>
            Cleanliness as a way of life. A wholesome attitude, a healthy body

          <p>
            A culture of altruism in the context of an educational institution
            where work is towards helping others with little regard for
            self-interest. Teachers impart knowledge and give of themselves
            unselfishly. Employees and administrators serve with the knowledge
            that service to others is their reason for being, and the school, as
            a community, gives back to society.
